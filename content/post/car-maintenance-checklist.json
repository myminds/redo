Regular service prevents major issues and maintains warranty coverage.</p><h3>Oil Changes</h3><p>Change engine oil every 3,000-7,500 miles depending on your vehicle and oil type. Check oil level monthly and top off as needed.</p><h3>Tire Care</h3><p>Check tire pressure monthly, rotate tires every 5,000-7,500 miles, and inspect for wear patterns. Proper inflation improves fuel efficiency and safety.</p><h3>Brake Inspection</h3><p>Have brakes inspected annually. Listen for squealing or grinding noises and have brake pads replaced before they wear completely.</p><h2>Fluid Checks</h2><p>Regularly check engine coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and windshield washer fluid. Top off or replace as needed.</p><h3>Battery Maintenance</h3><p>Clean battery terminals, check connections, and test battery voltage. Most batteries last 3-5 years depending on climate and usage.</p><h3>Filter Replacements</h3><p>Replace air filters, cabin air filters, and fuel filters according to schedule.
