Conduct surveys, interviews, and create minimum viable products (MVPs) to test assumptions.</p><h3>Building Your Team</h3><p>Hire complementary skills and shared vision. Look for people who are passionate about the problem you're solving, not just the solution.</p><h3>Funding Strategies</h3><p>Consider bootstrapping, angel investors, venture capital, or crowdfunding. Each option has different requirements and implications for your business.</p><h3>Product Development</h3><p>Focus on solving real problems for real customers. Iterate quickly based on feedback and prioritize features that drive user engagement and retention.</p><h2>Scaling Your Business</h2><p>As you grow, focus on systems, processes, and culture. Hire the right people, establish clear metrics, and maintain your company's core values.</p><h3>Common Pitfalls</h3><p>Avoid premature scaling, ignoring customer feedback, and running out of cash. Plan for multiple scenarios and maintain financial discipline.</p>"
